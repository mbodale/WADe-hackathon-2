        Conceptual Model Explanation Story - A Christmas Special
    </h1>
    <p>Christmas <b><i>holidays</i></b> are usually fulfilled by joy and <b><i>gift giving</i></b> (santa gives, children receive). The idea of gift giving includes knowing and respecting the target kid in terms of his <b><i>interests</i></b>, or any other relative <b><i>attributes</i></b> from demographic ones (<b><i>gender</i></b>, <b><i>age</i></b>, or <b><i>culture</i></b>) to self-induced ones. 
    <p>This year is different. This year is even harder for <b><i>Santa</i></b> to satisfy all the good kids. This year <b><i>Santa</i></b> is not looking only for the good kids, now he is also looking for the good and <b><i>negative tested</i></b> for coronavirus kids.  Besides that, <b><i>Santa</i></b> has a very small pool of available <b><i>intangible gifts</i></b> this year, for the less lucky ones. As long as he isn't a sibling for the kid, he can't give them a kiss, or even a hug and <b><i>Santa</i></b> RESPECTS this rule, no matter if they're a beautiful high school cheerleader hottie or a miopico-nerdy-MIT student, he can't touch them, at all!</p>
    <p>Who is <b><i>Santa</i></b>? <b><i>When</i></b> and <b><i>where</i></b> is he coming? To ease the explanation and to not deepen in paradoxal assertions, russians say that their Santa is named <b><i>Ded Moroz</i></b> and he is depicted as bringing presents to well-mannered children, often delivering them in person on <b><i>New Year's Eve</i></b> <i>.</i> On the other hand, the rest of the world has the standard version of Santa available this year, the red one with red nose and white beard who is coming to the homes of <b><i>well-behaved</i></b> and <b><i>negative-tested</i></b> children on the night of <b><i>Christmas Eve</i></b> (December 24th) or during the early morning hours of <b><i>Christmas Day</i></b>.</p>
    <p>In conclusion I would like to say that even if this year is different, <b><i>Santa</i></b> is not leaving us alone and will go from home to home, from kid to kid, to give them gifts, of course, while wearing a protection N95 mask in order to respect the new restrictions and if thereâ€™re more than 4 members in the family he will stay outside as long as the constraint regarding the maximum number of persons inside is not disposed of.</p>
